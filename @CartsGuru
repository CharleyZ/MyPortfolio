Objective

A trending topic is a Twitter hashtag that appears with a high frequency within a certain period of time. In this challenge, we will consider that a hashtag needs to appear at least 40 times in a 60 minutes period to be considered as a trending topic.

In this challenge, you need to determine if there is a trending topic in a hashtag flow. Hashtag in the flow are separated by one minute, so there are 60 tags in a 60 minutes flow.

Data format

Input
Row 1: an integer N comprised between 1 and 1000 corresponding to the number of hashtags in the flow.
Rows 2 to N+1: a Twitter hashtag. A hashtag contains only non-accentuated lowercase characters and starts with the # symbol.

Output
A string (starting with the # symbol) corresponding to the first (chronologically) trending topic, if any, otherwise the string No trending topic

e.g: 
sample01.txt  => #travel
sample02.txt  => No trending topic

     var preTag = rows[i-60];
     dict[preTag] -= 1;
     if (dict[preTag] == 0){
       delete dict[preTag];
     }
    }

    for (var key in dict) {
      if (dict[key] >= 40){

    }
