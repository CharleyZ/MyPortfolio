the origin matrix is :
1 1 0 1 
1 0 0 1 
0 0 0 0 
0 1 1 0 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 : 
The matrix is got by changing [3,1] to [0,2]
1 1 1 1 
1 0 0 1 
0 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 
aclot = 2   ,zclot = 1

Step 2 : 
The matrix is got by changing [3,2] to [1,1]
1 1 1 1 
1 1 0 1 
0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 
aclot = 1   ,zclot = 1
